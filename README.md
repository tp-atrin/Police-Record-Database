# Police-Record-Database-Application

## Introduction
This Python script implements a simple command-line interface (CLI) database application for managing police records including incidents, suspects, and officers. The script allows users to interact with the database by searching for records, adding new incidents and suspects, printing lists of records, and exiting the application.

- Search for records by suspect's name or incident ID.
- Add new incidents with date-time, location, felony, officer ID, and incident ID.
- Add new suspects with first name, last name, date of birth, address, phone number, and incident ID.
- Print lists of incidents, suspects, and officers.

## Usage 
1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
2. Run the script using the following command:
 ```
python3 police-db.py
 ```
3. The application will start in the command-line interface.

## Functionality
- The script provides a command-line menu with five options:
1. Search by name or incident ID: Allows you to search for suspects, incidents, and officers.
2. Add a new suspect: Adds a new suspect to the database.
3. Add a new incident: Adds a new incident to the database.
4. Print out the lists: Displays lists of incidents, suspects, and officers.
5. Quit: Exits the application.

- The "Search" option allows you to search for records by typing a suspect's name or incident ID. The search results are displayed in the console.

- The "Add a new suspect" and "Add a new incident" options prompt you to enter details for new suspects or incidents. The entered data is then added to the respective data files.

- The "Print out the lists" option displays lists of incidents, suspects, and officers in the console.

- The "Quit" option exits the application.

## Important Notes:
- The script reads data from three text files: incidents.txt, suspects.txt, and officers.txt. Make sure these files are present in the same directory as the script.
- Input validation and error handling have not been fully implemented in this version. Ensure valid input is provided during interactions.
- The text files contain random names generated by **chatGPT**.
